# Construction Domain RAG System

A Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system specialized for the construction industry, capable of answering queries about construction safety, project management, and regulations.

## System Architecture

    B --> C[Text Processing]
    C --> D[Vector Store]
    D --> E[RAG Chain]
    E --> F[Query Interface]
    
    subgraph "Data Sources"
        A1[PDF Documents] --> A
        A2[Kaggle Datasets] --> A
    end
    
    subgraph "Data Processing"
        B1[PDF Loader] --> B
        B2[Kaggle Loader] --> B
        C1[Text Splitting] --> C
        C2[Chunk Creation] --> C
    end
    
    subgraph "RAG Components"
        D1[FAISS Index] --> D
        D2[Embeddings] --> D
        E1[LLM] --> E
        E2[Prompt Template] --> E
    end
```

## Core Components

### 1. Data Loading (`ConstructionDataLoader`)
- Handles multiple data sources:
  - PDF documents (construction codes, safety guidelines)
  - Kaggle datasets (project management data)
- Implements flexible loading mechanisms for each data type
- Manages temporary storage for downloaded datasets

### 2. RAG System (`ConstructionRAG`)

```mermaid

    A[User Query] --> B[Retriever]
    B --> C[Vector Store]
    C --> D[Document Chain]
    D --> E[LLM]
    E --> F[Response]
    
    subgraph "Context Enhancement"
        C --> G[Top 5 Relevant Chunks]
        G --> D
    end
```

```

## Environment Setup

Required environment variables:
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: OpenAI API authentication
- Kaggle credentials (for dataset access)

## Directory Structure
```
construction-rag/
â”œâ”€â”€ main.py              # Core RAG implementation
â”œâ”€â”€ app.py              # Gradio interface
â”œâ”€â”€ requirements.txt     # Dependencies
â”œâ”€â”€ construction_data/   # PDF documents
â””â”€â”€ temp_kaggle_data/   # Temporary dataset storage
```

## Features
- Context-aware responses using RAG
- Multiple data source integration
- Structured response format
- Source attribution in answers
- Inference capabilities with transparency

## Query Examples
The system can handle queries about:
# What are the best practices for managing construction site safety?
# What are the minimum requirements for stairway construction in residential buildings?
# What are the fall protection requirements for construction workers?
# What are the emergency exit requirements for residential buildings? - no answer!
# What are the key safety measures required when working at heights?
# What are the common causes of construction project delays?
# What is the average duration of residential construction projects?
# How do material costs typically impact construction project budgets? - Inference
# What are the most common risk factors in construction project management?
# What is the relationship between project size and completion time?
# What are the fall protection requirements for construction workers?
# What are the best practices for managing construction site safety?
# How have construction costs changed over recent years? - no answer!
# What are the most important factors to consider in construction project planning?
# What are common quality control measures in construction projects?
# What documentation is required for construction project compliance?
