# Building Foundation Types
Shallow foundations are commonly used for small buildings. They include isolated footings, strip foundations, and raft foundations. Deep foundations like piles are used for larger structures or poor soil conditions.

# Concrete Mix Ratios
Standard concrete mix ratio is 1:2:4 (cement:sand:aggregate). High-strength concrete uses 1:1.5:3. Water-cement ratio should typically be between 0.45-0.60 for optimal strength.

# Building Safety Codes
All multi-story buildings must have fire exits at maximum 30m intervals. Minimum corridor width should be 1.5m. Emergency lighting must be provided every 20m.

# Sustainable Construction
Green building materials include recycled steel, bamboo, and reclaimed wood. Solar panels should be oriented south in northern hemisphere with 30-45 degree tilt.

# Construction Project Management
Critical path method (CPM) is essential for project scheduling. Typical construction phases: planning, foundation, structure, finishing, MEP installation.
